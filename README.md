# #my_approach_for_python
### 1.) to complete a big task or project, make lots of functions to split the big task into smaller ones, each function will do a piece of task.
### 2.) make flow chart diagram for the task or project you wanna complete.
### 3.) make to do list(comments inside program) for the project after breaking it down , then start with the easiest one.
### 4.) you can use stack overflow to ask about your errors in code.
## #DEBUGGING APPROACH:-
### (a) describe the problem.
### (b) some bugs occur only under certain conditions(not every time ) make them occur always.
### (c) see issue as if you are a computer.
### (d) use print to identify problem
### (e) use debugger
### (f) run your program in each step, before completing
### (g)can ask stack overflow
## #how do we built a program.
### 1.) problem definition
### 2.) problem analysis
### 3.) algorithm development
### 4.) coding
### 5.) testing and debugging
### 6.) looking for further modifications
### (g) use Ai and ask it to review and suggest improvements, that way you will learn new things.
